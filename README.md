Final Project for INST126 - Tuple Out Dice Game

The "Tuple Out" dice game has one or more players. The goal of this game is to score the most amount of 
points within the specified number of rounds chosen. In the game, each player will take turns rolling 
three die at a time to score points. If the player gets three die with the same number, they have "tupled
out" and their turn ends with zero points. If the player gets two out of the three die to have the same 
value, they are "fixed" and cannot be rerolled. However, the third die that is not the same can be re-
rolled as many times as they would like until they are satisfied or get the same number as the two other
die, meaning that they "tupled out". When the player is satisfied with their die, the score of their 
points will equal the total of the three die. This will end their turn and move to the next player. The
first player to reach the highest within a certain number of rounds wins!
